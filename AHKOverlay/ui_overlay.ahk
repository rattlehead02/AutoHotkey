; gdi+ ahk tutorial 3 written by tic (Tariq Porter)
; Requires Gdip.ahk either in your Lib folder as standard library or using #Include
;
; Tutorial to take make a gui from an existing image on disk
; For the example we will use png as it can handle transparencies. The image will also be halved in size
